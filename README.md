## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A working installation of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
- Access to your IMOU light(s) and relevant API/connection details.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sboli/imou.git
   cd imou
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**

   - Create a `.env` file and populate it with your configuration details. For example:

     ```env
     API_URL=
     APP_ID=
     APP_SECRET=
     ```

3. **Build and Run the Docker Container**
   This project is containerized for simplicity. Build and run the Docker container:

   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env imou
   ```

4. **Integrate with Home Assistant**

   - Use the IP address and port of the container (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) as the endpoint.

## Usage
